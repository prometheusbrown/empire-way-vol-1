Same Show 
BEAT: 
---

## Verse 1
everything we did before now just a preface
of everything to come, get ready for the flood
Act I finished, intermission nearly done
Act II, plot twist, audience is stunned
six million ways to die I chose none
stunted in the shade while they bathed in the sun 
what have I become? what is to be done?
the answer to the questions were buried in the mud
yuck... we dug it up
muddy as a mufucka, didn't give a fuck
shows in 2000 me and Gabe was in the front
six years later slinging albums out the trunk 
now we carry remnants of an era we survived
where not everybody made it to the other side  
many still around live far from the town
different space, different time but it’s still the same lives 

## Chorus 1 (8 bars - GT)

still that Northwest Classic
all the way from Langston down to 7th and Jackson
from open mic lights to headline attraction
still the same ... everlastin
(x2)


## Verse 2

I remember San Diego pulling up
Venue kinda fucked, Orko sayin "whut?"
Northwest bodies in the California sun
bored in two vans playing Born With Two Tongues
day one drama holding each other accountable
rappers paid less than fuckin tour manager
phones didn’t have no screens and no cameras
treating soundcheck like rehearsal like some amateurs
... wouldn’t change a thing tho
and that’s the thing, even tho you would think so
cause soon after that we was on separate paths
but it all routed back like these tracks always been home
... it’s why we kinfolk
nostalgia is a drug, reminiscing is essential
thanks for witnessing the journey so far
cause we far from the end of the same show

## Chorus 2 (8 bars - GT)

still that Northwest Classic
all the way from Langston down to 7th and Jackson
from open mic lights to headline attraction
still the same ... everlastin
(x2)

## Outro (GT)

*improvised shoutouts to town spaces*
