## Changes from Previous Version
- Initial recording
- Basic arrangement: acoustic guitar + vocals
- Scratch vocal, not final performance
- No production, just capturing the idea

## Technical Details
- **Format**: 48kHz / 24-bit WAV
- **Interface**: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2
- **Microphone**: Shure SM7B (vocals), Neumann KM184 (acoustic)
- **DAW Session**: Logic Pro X - "Song-Title-Demo-v1.logicx"

## What's Working
- The verse melody feels natural
- Chord progression in the pre-chorus creates good tension
- Overall vibe is coming through

## What Needs Work
- Chorus needs more energy - maybe bring in full band?
- Lyrics in verse 2 feel rushed
- Consider a key change or dynamic shift in the bridge
- Tempo might be slightly too fast (currently 132, try 128?)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Record demo v2 with full band arrangement
- [ ] Experiment with different chorus melody
- [ ] Try half-time feel in bridge
- [ ] Get feedback from producer
