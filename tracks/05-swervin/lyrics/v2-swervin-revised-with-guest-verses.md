## Verse 1 (24 bars - Prometheus Brown)
swervin thru the city seeing ghosts
looking for respite for the folks who need it most
no closure for the hope that had to close
threshold coming I can feel it coming close
what happens when it comes? wish that I could say
my fears wanna talk but I told em not today
put my hoodie up started walking in the rain
fate stood me up all I wanted was a date
the medicine was working til my tolerance increased
stopped posting shit saw my followers decrease
impossible arrangement with boundaries to keep
optimal engagement not optional for me
the people outside multiplying by the week
the people inside feeling mired by defeat 
they looking from the outside in tyrna creep
no fronting in my future cause i’m a different breed
…now I let it breathe
barley scratched the surface of my purpose underneath
thought I knew it all, turned out I was wrong
the fighter need to learn how to heal to find peace
truth under seige, youth wanna ride
we getting in the way? or learning how to guide
can’t front tho I miss the frontlines but I’m tired
happens when you been confronted your whole life

## Verse 2 (24 bars - Gabriel Teodros)
