## Intro (8 bars) 

some ride the wave, some shift the tide
some find a way, some way behind 
I’m making up for lost time
making up the lost time 
(x2)

## Verse 1 ()
There’s a lot that I can say I ain’t expressed yet
me and my best self haven’t even met yet
…I’d love to meet him, if you ever see him
Tell him geo said whatup, send him all my love
and if he got a moment for questions, can he answer:
how you handled all of your grudges and get past em
how you managing to not judge all my actions
how’s he not annoyed that he’s even being asked this? then ask him:
how you sleep so consistently?
how you balance the laughter with the misery?
do you even need these pills to stay busy
And protect your energy? thanks for forgiving me
howd the book I started writing years ago
Finally get finished, sent off and published
love what he did with the state that I left it 
stayed so objective, relaying all my messages
I know he’s older but I hope by not a lot
Hope he’s wearing the shoes I just bought
I hope he’s calm in his skin, We’ll call it a win 
if he ever gets to hear this song drop
Does he remember how long he got lost?
did he find his way back or did he end up far 
from where we started, What’s he writing bout? What’s he eating?
how is he coping with out the caffeine and nicotine
how does he balance being present in relationships
With being focused on the latest shit he’s taken with
what’s the secret? and why is he so hard to reach?
we got that in common at leastI hope he’s smiling at least
But tell him that I know he ain’t perfect, regardless
I know he’s done the work I just started
Before departing, please give him this pen
And tell him thank you for writing again

## Chorus 1

some ride the wave, some shift the tide
some find a way, some way behind 
I’m making up for lost time
making up the lost time 
(x2)

## Outro (Vocal sample scratches - 4 bars)

*it took a second... bout that time... but anyway* (x4)
