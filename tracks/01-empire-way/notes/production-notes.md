# Production Notes - Song Title

## Recording Sessions

### Session 1 - Jan 12, 2026
- **Goal**: Capture initial demo
- **Location**: Home studio
- **Attendance**: Artist only
- **Result**: Demo v1 completed
- **Notes**: Good foundation, needs full band

### Session 2 - Jan 18, 2026
- **Goal**: Record full band arrangement
- **Location**: [Studio Name]
- **Attendance**: Artist, Producer, Drummer, Bassist
- **Result**: Demo v2 with full arrangement
- **Notes**: 
  - Drummer nailed it in 3 takes
  - Bass needed punch - switched from P-bass to J-bass
  - Added synth pad for atmosphere

## Mix Decisions

### Vocals
- **Chain**: Neve 1073 preamp → LA-2A compressor → slight de-esser
- **Reverb**: EMT 140 plate (short decay for verses, longer for chorus)
- **Delay**: 1/4 note dotted, very subtle, panned right
- **Harmony**: 3-part in chorus only, panned wide

### Drums
- **Kick**: Punchy, 60Hz boost, gated reverb
- **Snare**: Fat and present, parallel compression
- **Room**: Generous room mics for space
- **Overall**: Compressed as a group for glue

### Guitar
- **Acoustic**: Natural, small-room reverb
- **Electric**: Bridge is clean with chorus effect, final chorus is overdriven
- **Amp**: Fender Deluxe Reverb, SM57 on-axis

### Bass
- **DI + Amp**: Blended 60/40 (DI/Amp)
- **Amp**: Ampeg SVT-VR through 8x10 cab
- **EQ**: Slight scoop at 400Hz, presence boost at 2kHz

## Master Bus Processing
- Analog-modeled SSL compressor (gentle 2:1 ratio)
- Slight saturation for warmth
- Final limiter: -1dB ceiling for streaming, -0.3dB for physical

## Reference Tracks
- [Artist Name - Song Title] for vocal production
- [Artist Name - Song Title] for drum sound
- [Artist Name - Song Title] for overall vibe and dynamics

## Producer Notes
> "The key to this track is restraint in the verses. We want the listener to FEEL the chorus when it hits. Don't over-produce the first half."  
> — [Producer Name], Jan 20, 2026

## Things We Tried That Didn't Work
- ❌ Bigger reverb on vocals (made it muddy)
- ❌ Sub-bass drop in the bridge (too trendy, didn't fit)
- ❌ Guitar solo (felt indulgent, removed it)
- ❌ Faster tempo (lost the groove)

## Things We Tried That DID Work
- ✅ Stripping back to just piano + vocal in bridge
- ✅ Adding subtle synth swell before final chorus
- ✅ Double-tracking acoustic guitar (panned L/R)
- ✅ Hand claps buried in the mix for texture

## Final Thoughts
This track really came together once we found the right balance between intimate and epic. The production serves the song rather than showing off.
