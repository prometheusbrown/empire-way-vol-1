## Mix Decisions

### Vocals
- **Chain**: xx preamp → xx compressor → xx de-esser
- **Reverb**: xx (short decay for verses, longer for chorus)
- **Delay**: 1/4 note dotted, very subtle, panned right
- **Harmony**: 3-part in chorus only, panned wide

### Drums
- **Kick**: (ex: Punchy, 60Hz boost, gated reverb)
- **Snare**: (ex: Fat and present, parallel compression)
- **Overall**: Compressed as a group for glue

### Instruments
- **Strings**: Natural, small-room reverb
- **Noise**: Bridge is clean with chorus effect, final chorus is overdriven
- **Misc**: Fender Deluxe Reverb, SM57 on-axis

### Bass
- **DI + Amp**: Blended 60/40 (DI/Amp)
- **Amp**: Ampeg SVT-VR through 8x10 cab
- **EQ**: Slight scoop at 400Hz, presence boost at 2kHz

## Master Bus Processing
- Analog-modeled SSL compressor (gentle 2:1 ratio)
- Slight saturation for warmth
- Final limiter: -1dB ceiling for streaming, -0.3dB for physical

## Reference Tracks
- [Blue Scholars - Solstice: Re-Introduction] vocal production
- [Slick Rick - Kill Niggaz] overall vibe and dynamics

## Producer Notes
> "The key to this track is restraint in the verses. We want the listener to FEEL the chorus when it hits. Don't over-produce the first half."
