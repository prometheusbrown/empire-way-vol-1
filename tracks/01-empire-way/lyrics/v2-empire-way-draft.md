## Verse 1 - Prometheus Brown (16 bars)
OK. I was born round the time MLK  
replaced what was once called Empire Way  
After the interstate went and did the thing  
To displace, separate the sound from lake  
White man push Red man to the edge  
Regrade the hills, fill the wet wet lands  
labor was the source industrial demand   
send this one up for the Words that he said  
better go east If a earthquake hit  
Everything west of beacon hill- go to shit  
South of Downtown, Georgetown that’s it  
Mother Nature gon take back what she give  
the first caretakers moved around  
Depending on the season they in and out  
Tahoma in the background wherever you stay  
Until they all came, for the...

## Verse 1 - Dakota Camacho (16 bars)
one day, Guåhan will be where americas day ends   
Rename Marine Drive after Mama Jill and Uncle Ed  
Empire Falls our Man Anghet ascends  
we’ll weave a giant net out of military fence  
to catch the monstrous fish of greed and violence  
once came for our land, but our famalao’an said  
you won’t eat up our coast and separate our folks  
this an ancient story, now the fish a taotaomo’na  
red white and blue but not a låggua  
devourin our lands, our waters, and our cultures  
Now our family enlisted, to do the fish’s business  
When we call it how it is — its like we strengthening division  
this confusion is a prison that puts migrants in prison   
profits off of genocide and keeps the monster swimming   
good medicine’s our culture when the orators spitting   
the fish’s time is finished, let’s go prepare the kitchen  

## Chorus - Dakota (8 bars)
It’s the Empire Way, the Giant Fish attacks
the women cut their hair and wove a net so we can catch
Happy 250 to America You had a Good Run 
Now you kelaguen, bruh
(2x)
