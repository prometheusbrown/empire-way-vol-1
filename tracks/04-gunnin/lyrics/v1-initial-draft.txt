## Verse 1
OK I was born round the time MLK
replaced what was once called Empire Way
After the interstate went and did the thing
To displace, separate the sound from lake 

White man push Red man to the edge
Regrade the hills, fill the wet wet lands
labor was the source industrial demand 
send this one up for the Words that he said

better go east If a earthquake hit
Everything west of beacon hill- go to shit
South of Downtown, Georgetown that’s it
Mother Nature gon take back what she give

the first caretakers moved around
Depending on the season they in and out
Tahoma in the background wherever you stay
Until they all came 

## Chorus
Empire Way
Time to do the math
The average one last 
2 centuries and a half

So happy 250
To America
You had a good run
now you cooked
Well done

Empire Way
Time to do the math
The average one last 
2 centuries and a half

So happy 250
To America
You had a good run
now you cooked
Well done
