---

## Intro (4 bars)
Big bags bumbling bad fumbling up since 
back bumping crumbling erb
when bill Clinton on the sax no wonder they in pandering mode, 
hacking the hard code, ARs loaded 

## Verse 1 (16 bars)
few things more potent than fear of your opponent
It’s how the opportunist take a hold of the moment
the last thing that I do this shit for is to be quoted 
I would rather not live it than need to hear it spoken
lead to feeling broken
heart closing where is the key to keep it open
Ineptitude era in full swing the sheen on the statue corroded
Its only news cause you never really bothered to notice
the newer me’s an older me, the older me was newer
The cycle aint a circle, it spiral moving through ya
I’m with my tribe yelling boo ya, uce
Top ten play alley oop put it thru the hoop
Who the two G’s one T and one Q
From the Westside 47 six north latitude
Used to organize, now I coordinate
from the pit orchestrated done with more gratitude
