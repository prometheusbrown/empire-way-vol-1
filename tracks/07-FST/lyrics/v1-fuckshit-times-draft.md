## Verse 1

living in these fuckshit times
got me feeling like fuck these rhymes
I know it open up minds but right now it ain’t opening mine
I had a talk with Njuguna he reminded me why
we gotta be who we been, plus be who we becoming 
and be in the present cuz presently we buggin 
and who we are right now is a superposition 
spinning in both directions because everything is Physics
see what I did there? dare to be specfic
careful what you wish, send the message like
a carrier pigeon, or your uncle speaking pidgin
but don't forget, let me get the stems to the session
who said the youth don't listen? i don't believe it
'cause even if it's true, old people don't either
screaming season, peak "well actually"
arguing the facts with no consensus reality

## Chorus 1

and we like, "fuck this shit"
(x2)
