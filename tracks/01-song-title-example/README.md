## Production Notes

- Verse: Minimal - just vocals, acoustic guitar, subtle pad
- Chorus: Full band enters with drums and bass
- Bridge: Strip back to piano and vocals before final chorus

### Instrumentation
- Electric guitar (verse riff in drop D)
- Bass (root notes, some walking in pre-chorus)
- Drums (live kit, recorded in one take)
- Synth pad (atmospheric, Juno-60 style)
- Vocals (lead + 3-part harmony in chorus)

### Mix Notes
- Vocal sits slightly above the mix
- Heavy compression on drums for punch
- Long reverb tail on final chorus for impact
