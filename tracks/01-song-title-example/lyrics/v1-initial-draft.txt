# Song Title - Lyrics v1 (Initial Draft)

**Date**: January 10, 2026  
**Status**: Draft  
**Notes**: First ideas, rough structure. Placeholder chorus needs work.

---

## Verse 1
[Your lyrics here]
Lines about the main theme
Setting up the story
Building anticipation

## Chorus
[Placeholder chorus - needs stronger hook]
Repeated phrase
Main emotional core
Memorable melody line

## Verse 2
[Your lyrics here]
Development of the theme
Adding new perspective
Leading to bridge

## Bridge
[Your lyrics here]
Moment of reflection
Key change or dynamic shift
Setting up final chorus

## Chorus (Final)
[Same as first chorus]
With added harmonies
And fuller arrangement

---

## Notes for v2
- Chorus feels generic, need stronger imagery
- Consider changing "placeholder phrase" to something more specific
- Bridge might be too long, try cutting two lines
- Overall tone: introspective but hopeful
