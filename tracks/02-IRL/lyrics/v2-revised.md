# IRL - Lyrics v1 (Initial Draft)

**Date**: 2025-09-12
**Status**: Revision  
**Notes**: Spontaneously written--felt like project needed something more "current," addressing things that have happened since the bulk of project songs were written and recorded.

BEAT: fresh one

## Intro - Chorus
they say the world gon end, I say it need to begin
either we eating or we leaving again
resuscitated now we breathing again
you only speak one language you don’t know where we been

## Verse 1 (36 bars)
lets begin, sorry for the wait
it got a little heavy, not sorry for the weight
running by the lake, tryna find a way
to live long enough to see a brighter day
now they bars ok but they barely ever great
my old-ass bars stayed relevant today
rappers showed up to the rally hella late
I’m early so I party like it’s 1998 
Prince wit his old band Revolution frontman
resident of Brownland permanently sun tanned
(and) known to leave a impact haircut 
slicked back soul position intact
quiet ones never tell 
we dont need another reason to rebel
alternative to feeling underwhelmed
you never heard of us, you telling on yourself
ordinary guy legendary run 
literary heavyweight who literally cook
little did he know bigger bro really flow
so please don’t, let me be misunderstood
big bag bros playing x that o
like its tic tac toe 
don’t know bout you but I been that pro
used to rock a fitted with the brim flat low
7 three-quarters that’s a big ass dome
been back home haven’t really traveled
outside the west coast in a really long time
early 2020 flew out Manila right before the pandemmy
now everybody worse for wear, bad fashion
but thank you asking, i'm feeling fantastic 
that was sarcastic fed you the subtext
context collision, now everybody suspect 
what’s next? let me tell you what isn’t 
game time decision playing When you injured
weighing if it’s worth it, world keep burning
one things for certain, they got us all cursing that

# Chorus 1 (4 bars)
world gon end
I say it need to begin
either we eating or we leaving again
resuscitated now we breathing again
you only speak one language 
you don’t know where we been

# Bridge 1 (4 bars)

where we been / where we been
who you know / who you know
what it is / what it is
where you go / where you go
(x2)

# Verse 2 (32 bars)
knick knack petty ass leave your dog alone
i be on the low, pro lurking at a show
if I don't really know you faka leave me alone
whiplash head crash peace I gotta go
we be up nights tryna stay upright
this small biz shit is damaging to love life
keep my coffee hot Fuck ICE
give a fuck I bring a bolo to a gunfight
stay poised when they poison the well
got no choice but to voice it as the well
party people make noise for yourselves
the middle punching left can't hit very well
permitted protesting with no demands
and permission from cops playin right in their hands
using the platform a form of surveillance
to de-liberate us and fight with your fans 
leave us engaging with faceless opponents
deliberately making up makeshift personas
and taking up space like colonial borders
I’m older, uncle, I’m done with performance
fuck all of it, war crime apologists
napalm to phosphorus, no due process 
just obvious lawlessness, no shot callers
death tax ballers send cash to valhalla
watch the price spike like a volleyballer doin molly
when you do it it's a hobby when we do it we embody
Cal Raleigh, send it, catch heat for speaking
watch the game from the 300 level smoking reefer
gg, they cheesed, they came, they bailed
ragequitters blaming people for their ls 
we aint cooked, we cooking the whole meal
and we serve it to whoever don't believe the old tale that

# Chorus 2 (4 bars)

the world gon end
I say it need to begin
either we eating or we leaving again
rescuscitated now we breathing again
you only speak one language you don't know where we been

# Bridge 2 (4 bars)

where we been / where we been
who you know / who you know
what it is / what it is
where you go / where you go
(x2)

# Outro (8 bars)

where we been / where we been
where we been / where we been
we been at your moms house with her friends
we been watching yall crash out it again
been to hell and back, heaven let us in

where we been / where we been
where we been / where we been
we been here the whole time tryna live
we been IRL with the kids
you on URLs talking shit
