## Intro Chorus (4 bars)
Am I running from yesterday
Or running to tomorrow?
Am I running from pain?
Or am I running toward more?
(x2)

## Verse 1 (22 bars)
I ran a marathon and told nobody bout it
I’m way more bout it than to make it an announcement 
Wasn’t always like this, wanted the attention
the need for validation hella real when you de-centered
and barely ever mentioned, historically neglected 
doing all the work and watching others take the credit
longing for connection being seen and being heard
too much isolation leave you feeling unprotected
so yeah fam I get it, the age we live in
analog reflection, digital confession
the whole world wanna see through you in a second
but visibility’s no substitution for resistance
traded in our patience and replaced with surveillance
equated self-snitching with a quick emancipation
pendulum swinging so tough it’s speeding time up
non participation don’t fit in this equation 
especially for creatives and workers of the culture
depending on a audience to take their labor further 
with spaces saturated while the quality diluted
fishing for engagement but the water been polluted
long story shorter I been gone and going thru it
and running was the movement that I found more therapeutic
everywhere I go I try to leave it how I found it
That’s why I ran a marathon and told nobody bout it

## Chorus 1

Am I running from yesterday
Or running to tomorrow?
Am I running from pain?
Or am I running toward more?
(x2)
